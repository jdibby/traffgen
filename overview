✅ Connectivity Tests
DNS Queries (dig_random)
Tests resolution of randomized domains using a shuffled list of DNS servers.

Ping/ICMP (ping_random)
Sends ICMP ping requests to a list of IPs to test reachability.

Traceroute (traceroute_random)
Traces the network path to a list of IPs using traceroute.

SSH Connectivity (ssh_random)
Attempts SSH connections to various endpoints using batch mode (non-interactive).

NTP Sync (ntp_random)
Uses chronyd to query NTP servers for time synchronization.

✅ HTTP/HTTPS Performance and Behavior
HTTP Requests (http_random)
Sends randomized HTTP HEAD requests to various URLs using different User-Agent headers.

HTTP File Downloads (http_download_zip, http_download_targz)
Tests download performance for ZIP and .tar.gz files over HTTP.

HTTPS Requests (https_random)
Same as HTTP requests but over HTTPS.

HTTPS Web Crawling (https_crawl)
Crawls HTTPS sites to a configurable depth by following anchor links.

AI Site Test (ai_https_random)
Sends HTTPS HEAD requests to a list of AI-related URLs.

Ad Filtering Test (ads_random)
Sends HEAD requests to ad-serving domains.

URL Response Time (urlresponse_random)
Measures response time of HTTPS requests to determine latency/performance.

✅ File and Content Downloads
FTP File Download (ftp_random)
Uses curl to download DB files via FTP from a public speed test server.

Big File Download (bigfile)
Downloads a 5GB file with progress bar to test large file handling and throughput.

✅ Security and Threat Simulation
EICAR Virus Simulation over HTTP/HTTPS (virus_sim_http, virus_sim_https)
Downloads EICAR test files to trigger antivirus or web security tools.

Nmap Port Scan (nmap_1024os)
Performs a scan of TCP ports 1–1024 on target IPs.

Nmap CVE/Script Scan (nmap_cve)
Performs an in-depth vulnerability scan using Nmap scripts.

IPS Detection Trigger (ips)
Sends a known test User-Agent string (BlackSun) to simulate malicious traffic and trigger intrusion prevention systems.

✅ Streaming and Speed Test
Netflix Speed Test (speedtest_fast)
Uses the fastcli CLI for fast.com to measure download speed.

✅ Web Crawling and Link Traversal
Web Crawl (webcrawl)
Starts from a specified URL and crawls a number of links up to a set depth.

✅ Meta Features
--suite flag: Select which test suite(s) to run.

--size flag: Controls number of targets and intensity (S, M, L, XL).

--loop flag: Repeats tests continuously with a random wait between runs.

--nowait flag: Skips the wait between loop iterations.

--max-wait-secs flag: Sets the upper bound of the random wait interval.
