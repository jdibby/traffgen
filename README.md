### üîß Connectivity Tests

| ‚úÖ Test | üß© Function | üß© Suite Flag |üîç Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DNS Lookup** | `dig_random` | `dns` | Performs **DNS A record resolution** for a set of randomly selected domains using multiple pre-configured **DNS recursive resolvers**. This assesses **DNS service availability** and **name resolution latency**. |
| **ICMP Ping** | `ping_random` | `icmp`  | Executes **ICMP Echo Request/Reply transactions** to a range of pre-defined IP addresses. This verifies fundamental **network layer reachability** and measures **round-trip time (RTT)** and **packet loss**. |

| **ZIP File Download** | `http_download_zip` | `http` | Initiates **HTTP downloads of `.zip` archives** across multiple predefined file sizes (e.g., 1MB, 10MB, 100MB). This evaluates **data throughput**, **file integrity**, and **HTTP range request support**. |
| **TAR.GZ Download** | `http_download_targz` | `http` | Downloads the latest stable release of the **WordPress core `.tar.gz` archive** via HTTP. This specifically tests retrieval of a common compressed software distribution. |
| **HTTPS Requests** | `https_random` | `https` | Transmits **HTTPS/TLS GET requests** to secure web servers, utilizing randomized `User-Agent` strings. This validates **TLS handshake completion**, **certificate chain validation**, and **secure web content retrieval**. |
| **URL Response Timing** | `urlresponse_random` | `url-response` | Measures the **end-to-end response time** for both HTTP and HTTPS requests to a diverse set of URLs. This provides metrics on **web server latency** and **network performance** for web traffic. |
| **HTTPS Crawler** | `https_crawl` | `https` | Recursively traverses hyperlinks within **HTTPS-secured web pages** from a specified starting URL. This simulates legitimate web browsing and tests the ability to navigate secure sites. |
| **HTTP Crawler** | `webcrawl` | `crawl` | Recursively traverses hyperlinks within **HTTP-unsecured web pages** from a specified starting URL. This simulates legitimate web browsing. |

### üîí Security & Filtering Tests

| ‚úÖ Test | üß© Function | üß© Suite Flag |üîç Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EICAR Test (HTTP and HTTPS)** | `virus_sim` | `virus` | Attempts to download the **EICAR (European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research) test file** over HTTP(s). This is designed to trigger **antivirus and malware detection mechanisms** without causing actual harm. |
| **IPS Detection** | `ips` | `ips` | Sends HTTP requests containing **known malicious `User-Agent` strings** or **HTTP request patterns** designed to trigger an IPS**. This verifies signature-based IPS rules. |
| **DLP Simulation** | `dlp_sim_https` | `dlp` | Initiates downloads of files containing **simulated Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** and **Payment Card Industry (PCI) data patterns**. This evaluates the detection capabilities of **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems**. |
| **Malware User-Agents** | `malware_random` | `malware-agents` | Transmits HTTP requests with **`User-Agent` headers associated with known malware, botnets, or malicious scanners**. This aims to provoke responses from **web application firewalls (WAFs)** or **threat intelligence feeds**. |

| **Domain Filtering Checks** | `github_domain_check` | `domain-check` | This check executes **domain resolution and reachability test** against a verified list of unsecure and unsafe domains. This list is maintained as a **publicly accessible data stream** via GitHub. The process is designed to test security controls preventing access to known undesirable domains, encompassing categories such as **adware distribution, malicious software propagation, host-based viral infections, deceptive content delivery, and various forms of online fraud and social engineering schemes**. |
| **Phishing Domain Filtering Checks** | `github_phishing_domain_check` | `phishing-domains` | This check executes **phishing domain resolution and reachability test** against a verified list of known phishing domains. This list is maintained as a **publicly accessible data stream** via GitHub. The process is designed to test security controls preventing access to these known undesirable domains. |

These variations are derived from a static list of real domains in endpoints.py. The goal is to test security controls that prevent access to these undesirable lookalike domains. |
| **Nikto Scans** | `web_scanner` | `web-scanner` | Launches a Nikto web vulnerability scan against `testmyids.com`, emulating attacker reconnaissance behavior. Scan intensity is configurable via the `--size` argument (`S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`), which adjusts the `-maxtime` value (60‚Äì240 seconds). All scans use a forced 1-second request timeout to simulate aggressive probing. Commonly used to validate web-based IDS detection of high-noise application-layer scans. |
| **Metasploit Checks** | `metasploit_check` | `metasploit-check` | Runs randomized **Metasploit `.rc` scripts** in `check` mode against targets listed in `targets.list`. Each script includes 2‚Äì5 modules from categories like **web**, **SSH**, **SMB**, and **fuzzing**. All modules use `check` only (no exploitation), include `THREADS 1`, and inject a `sleep 2` delay between checks to simulate slow scans. This activity is designed to **trigger IDS/IPS alerts** for lab validation and blue team exercises without causing system compromise. |
| **Kyber Tests** | `kyber_random` | `kyber` | Transmits **HTTPS/TLS GET requests** to secure web servers, utilizing randomized `User-Agent` strings. This validates **TLS handshake completion**, **certificate chain validation**, and **secure web content retrieval**. What is unique is this test simulates Kyber encrypted client hellos (ECH). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command-Line Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--suite` | Specifies the **test suite(s)** to execute. Accepted arguments include predefined categories such as `all` (all available tests), `http`, `dns`, `nmap`. This allows for more focused testing. |
| `--size` | Defines the **scale or intensity of the test execution**. Options include `S` (Small), `M` (Medium), `L` (Large), and `XL` (Extra Large), which typically correlate to the number of iterations, concurrency, or data volume. |
| `--loop` | Activates **continuous test execution**, causing the selected test suite to run in an infinite loop until manually terminated. Ideal for long-duration network monitoring. |
| `--max-wait-secs` | Sets the **maximum randomized delay** (in seconds) that will be introduced between successive iterations when the `--loop` flag is active. This helps simulate more realistic traffic patterns and prevent overwhelming remote systems. |
| `--nowait` | Disables all **randomized delays** between individual test executions. This provides the fastest possible execution of tests, suitable for faster reporting on remote systems and stress testing of networks. |
| `--crawl-start` | Designates the **initial URL** from which the HTTP (`webcrawl`) or HTTPS (`https_crawl`) web crawlers will start their recursive link traversal. |
